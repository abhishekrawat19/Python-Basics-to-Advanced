# Tuple in Python

## What is a Tuple?
A **tuple** is an ordered, immutable collection of elements in Python. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation (i.e., they are immutable). Tuples allow storing multiple items in a single variable.

## Characteristics of Tuples:
- **Ordered**: Elements have a fixed order.
- **Immutable**: Cannot be changed after creation.
- **Allows Duplicate Values**: Can store multiple occurrences of the same value.
- **Can Store Multiple Data Types**: Supports integers, strings, floats, etc.
- **Faster than Lists**: Due to immutability, they have better performance.

## Creating a Tuple:
```python
# Creating a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(my_tuple)

# Creating a tuple with mixed data types
tuple_mixed = (1, "Hello", 3.14, True)
print(tuple_mixed)

# Creating a tuple with a single element (comma is required)
single_element_tuple = (42,)
print(single_element_tuple)
```

## Tuple Indexing and Slicing
```python
# Accessing elements using indexing
my_tuple = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
print(my_tuple[0])  # Output: 10
print(my_tuple[-1]) # Output: 50

# Slicing a tuple
print(my_tuple[1:4]) # Output: (20, 30, 40)
print(my_tuple[:3])  # Output: (10, 20, 30)
print(my_tuple[2:])  # Output: (30, 40, 50)
```

## Tuple Operations
```python
# Concatenation
tuple1 = (1, 2, 3)
tuple2 = (4, 5, 6)
result = tuple1 + tuple2
print(result)  # Output: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

# Repetition
repeat_tuple = ("Hello",) * 3
print(repeat_tuple)  # Output: ('Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello')
```

## Tuple Methods
Tuples have limited methods due to their immutability. Here are the most commonly used ones:

### 1. `count()`
Counts the number of occurrences of a specific element.
```python
tuple_numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5)
print(tuple_numbers.count(2))  # Output: 3
```

### 2. `index()`
Returns the index of the first occurrence of a specified value.
```python
tuple_values = (10, 20, 30, 40, 20)
print(tuple_values.index(20))  # Output: 1
```

## Advanced Tuple Features

### 1. Tuple Packing and Unpacking
```python
# Packing
data = ("Alice", 25, "Engineer")

# Unpacking
name, age, profession = data
print(name)      # Output: Alice
print(age)       # Output: 25
print(profession) # Output: Engineer
```

### 2. Nested Tuples
```python
tuple_nested = (1, (2, 3), (4, 5, 6))
print(tuple_nested[1])  # Output: (2, 3)
print(tuple_nested[2][1])  # Output: 5
```

### 3. Tuple as Dictionary Keys
Since tuples are immutable, they can be used as keys in dictionaries, unlike lists.
```python
coordinates = {(0, 0): "Origin", (1, 2): "Point A", (3, 4): "Point B"}
print(coordinates[(1, 2)])  # Output: Point A
```

### 4. Memory Efficiency (Compared to Lists)
Tuples consume less memory than lists and have better performance.
```python
import sys
list_example = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
tuple_example = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(sys.getsizeof(list_example))  # Larger memory size
print(sys.getsizeof(tuple_example))  # Smaller memory size
```

### 5. Iterating Over a Tuple
```python
my_tuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for item in my_tuple:
    print(item)
```

## Immutable Nature of Tuples
```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
# my_tuple[1] = 100  # This will raise an error since tuples are immutable
```

## When to Use Tuples?
- When you need an immutable sequence of values.
- When using dictionary keys that should not be modified.
- When working with fixed data structures, such as database records.
