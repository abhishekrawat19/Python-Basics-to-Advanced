# Python Glossary

## A
- **Argument**: A value passed to a function when calling it. It can be positional or keyword-based and is used to provide input to a function.
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Operators that perform mathematical operations such as addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).
- **Assertion (`assert`)**: A debugging aid that tests a condition. If the condition is false, an `AssertionError` is raised.
- **Attribute**: A variable or method associated with an object. Attributes store data or define behavior for an object.
- **Async/Await**: Keywords used to define and handle asynchronous programming, allowing non-blocking execution of tasks.

## B
- **Boolean**: A data type with two possible values: `True` or `False`. It is often used in conditional expressions and logical operations.
- **Break**: A control statement that exits a loop immediately, preventing further iterations.
- **Built-in Functions**: Functions that are available in Python without needing an import, such as `print()`, `len()`, and `type()`.
- **Bytecode**: A low-level set of instructions that Python compiles scripts into before executing them using the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).

## C
- **Class**: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines attributes and methods that determine the behavior of objects instantiated from it.
- **Comment**: A line of text in the code that is ignored by the Python interpreter. Used to add explanations and improve code readability (`#` for single-line, `'''` or `"""` for multi-line).
- **Concatenation**: The process of joining two or more strings together, typically using the `+` operator or `join()` method.
- **Conditional Statements**: Statements like `if`, `elif`, and `else` that control the flow of execution based on conditions.
- **Context Manager (`with` statement)**: A mechanism for managing resources such as file handling that ensures proper cleanup.
- **Comprehension (List, Set, Dict)**: A concise way to create lists, sets, or dictionaries using a single line of code.

## D
- **Data Type**: The classification of data items, such as `int`, `float`, `str`, `list`, and `dict`.
- **Dictionary**: A mutable data structure that stores key-value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable, while values can be of any data type.
- **Docstring**: A special type of comment enclosed in triple quotes (`""" ... """` or `''' ... '''`) used to describe a module, function, or class.
- **Decorator**: A function that takes another function as input and extends its behavior without modifying it directly.
- **Dynamic Typing**: Python determines variable types at runtime, allowing flexibility in variable assignment.

## E
- **Exception**: An event that disrupts the normal execution of a program. Python provides built-in exception handling using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.
- **Exception Handling**: A method for handling errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to prevent crashes.
- **Encapsulation**: The concept of restricting direct access to some components of an object to ensure data integrity.
- **Eval()**: A function that parses and executes expressions as Python code at runtime.

## F
- **Function**: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Defined using the `def` keyword, it can accept arguments and return values.
- **For Loop**: A control structure that iterates over a sequence, such as a list or tuple.
- **Format Strings**: A way to insert variables into strings using `f"{variable}"`, `.format()`, or `%` formatting.
- **Frozen Set**: An immutable version of a set.

## G
- **Generator**: A special type of iterator that yields values lazily using the `yield` keyword, allowing efficient memory use.
- **Garbage Collection**: The process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use.
- **Global Variable**: A variable declared outside any function, accessible throughout the script.

## I
- **Immutable**: A property of objects that prevents modification after creation. Examples include tuples, strings, and numbers.
- **Indentation**: The whitespace used at the beginning of a line to define the structure of blocks in Python. Unlike other languages, Python enforces indentation as part of its syntax.
- **Import**: The process of including external modules in a Python script using the `import` statement.
- **Iterable**: Any object that can return its elements one at a time, such as lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

## L
- **Lambda Function**: An anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword.
- **List**: A mutable, ordered collection of elements that can store different data types. Lists allow indexing, slicing, and modification.
- **Loop**: A programming construct used to execute a block of code multiple times. Python provides `for` and `while` loops.

## M
- **Method**: A function that is associated with an object and can operate on its attributes. Methods are defined within a class and can be accessed using the dot notation (`object.method()`).
- **Module**: A file containing Python code, including functions, classes, and variables. Modules can be imported using the `import` statement to reuse code.
- **Mutable**: A property of objects that allows modification after creation. Lists and dictionaries are mutable.
- **Map()**: A built-in function used to apply a function to all items in an iterable.

## O
- **Object**: An instance of a class. It represents real-world entities and has attributes and behaviors defined by its class.
- **Operator**: A symbol that performs operations on variables and values. Operators include arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`), and logical (`and`, `or`, `not`).

## P
- **Pass**: A placeholder statement that does nothing. Used in places where a statement is syntactically required but no action is needed.
- **Print**: A built-in function that outputs text or variables to the console.
- **Polymorphism**: The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a shared interface.

## S
- **Set**: An unordered collection of unique elements. Sets do not allow duplicate values and support mathematical operations like union and intersection.
- **String**: A sequence of characters enclosed in single (`'...'`), double (`"..."`), or triple quotes (`'''...'''` or `"""..."""`). Strings are immutable.
- **Scope**: The region where a variable is accessible. It can be local, global, or nonlocal.

## T
- **Tuple**: An immutable, ordered collection of elements. Unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after creation and are commonly used to store related data.
- **Try-Except**: A block of code used for handling exceptions to prevent runtime errors.
- **Type Casting**: Converting one data type into another, such as `int("10")` converting a string into an integer.

## V
- **Variable**: A named reference that stores a value in memory. Variables do not require explicit declaration and can hold different data types.
- **Virtual Environment**: A self-contained Python environment used to manage dependencies and packages separately from the system Python installation.

## W
- **While Loop**: A loop that continues execution as long as a specified condition remains `True`. If the condition never becomes `False`, it results in an infinite loop.
- **With Statement**: Used for resource management, ensuring that files and other resources are properly closed after use.
