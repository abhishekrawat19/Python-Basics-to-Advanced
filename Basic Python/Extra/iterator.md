# Iterable vs Iterator in Python

## **1. What is an Iterable?**
An **Iterable** is any Python object that can return its elements one at a time. It implements the `__iter__()` method, which returns an **Iterator**.

### **Examples of Iterables**
- Lists: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Tuples: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Strings: `'hello'`
- Dictionaries: `{'a': 1, 'b': 2}`
- Sets: `{1, 2, 3}`
- Custom objects that implement `__iter__()`

### **Example of an Iterable**
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
for item in my_list:  # The iterable provides elements one by one
    print(item)
```

## **2. What is an Iterator?**
An **Iterator** is an object that keeps track of where it is in a sequence. It implements two special methods:
1. `__iter__()`: Returns itself (the iterator object)
2. `__next__()`: Returns the next item and moves forward in the sequence. Raises `StopIteration` when elements are exhausted.

### **Example of an Iterator**
```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30]
iterator = iter(my_list)  # Converting list to an iterator

print(next(iterator))  # Output: 10
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 20
print(next(iterator))  # Output: 30
print(next(iterator))  # Raises StopIteration
```

## **3. Key Differences: Iterable vs Iterator**
| Feature      | **Iterable** | **Iterator** |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Definition** | An object that can return an iterator. | An object that keeps state and returns the next value. |
| **Methods** | Implements `__iter__()` | Implements both `__iter__()` and `__next__()` |
| **State Tracking** | No state tracking | Keeps track of its current position |
| **Usage** | Can be looped over (for-loop) | Must use `next()` to retrieve elements manually |
| **Examples** | List, Tuple, String, Dict, Set | Object returned by `iter(iterable)` |

## **4. Converting an Iterable to an Iterator**
You can use the `iter()` function to convert an iterable into an iterator.
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
it = iter(numbers)  # Now 'it' is an iterator
print(next(it))  # 1
print(next(it))  # 2
print(next(it))  # 3
print(next(it))  # Raises StopIteration
```

## **5. Creating a Custom Iterator**
We can define a class that implements `__iter__()` and `__next__()`.

### **Example: Custom Iterator that Generates Even Numbers**
```python
class EvenNumbers:
    def __init__(self, max):
        self.max = max
        self.current = 0
    
    def __iter__(self):
        return self  # Returns itself as an iterator
    
    def __next__(self):
        if self.current > self.max:
            raise StopIteration
        self.current += 2
        return self.current - 2

# Using the custom iterator
even_iter = EvenNumbers(10)
for num in even_iter:
    print(num)  # Output: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
```

## **6. Iterators are Exhaustible**
Once an iterator is consumed, it cannot be reset unless explicitly recreated.
```python
numbers = [5, 10, 15]
it = iter(numbers)
print(next(it))  # 5
print(next(it))  # 10
print(next(it))  # 15
print(next(it))  # Raises StopIteration (No more items)
```

## **7. Generators as Iterators**
A **generator** is a special type of iterator that yields values using `yield` instead of `return`. Generators are memory-efficient.

### **Example: Generator Function**
```python
def my_generator():
    yield 1
    yield 2
    yield 3

gen = my_generator()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
print(next(gen))  # 3
print(next(gen))  # Raises StopIteration
```

## **8. When to Use Iterables vs Iterators?**
- **Use Iterables** when you want to loop over data multiple times (e.g., lists, tuples).
- **Use Iterators** when you need to process elements one at a time and donâ€™t want to store everything in memory (e.g., large datasets, streaming data).

---
### **Summary**
- **Iterable**: Can return an iterator but doesnâ€™t track position.
- **Iterator**: Tracks position and produces values one by one with `next()`.
- **Iterators are consumed once and canâ€™t be restarted unless recreated.**
- **Generators are iterators that use `yield` and are more memory-efficient.**
